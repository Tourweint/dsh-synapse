// Two regressions found by driving the real map with trusted input (CDP):
//
//   1. Switching conversation changed the state but never moved the camera, so
//      the newly active cards sat thousands of pixels off screen and the map
//      looked frozen — a click that worked read as a dead button.
//   2. `openDshWorkspace` handed out a ticket (`++state.workspaceLoad`); the 1s
//      projection poll took a newer ticket while the user's load was awaiting,
//      so the user's load returned before rendering and the sidebar kept the
//      previous workspace's sessions.
