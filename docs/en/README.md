# dsh-synapse English Guide

`dsh-synapse` is a Web plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH). It adds a session map to the native conversation interface and organizes sessions, follow-ups, and forks from the same workspace as a browsable, draggable, and zoomable canvas.

The plugin does not replace DSH models, tools, sessions, permissions, or the Web server. DSH remains responsible for every conversation operation.

## Prerequisites

- DeepSeek Harness `>= 0.1.7-rc.2`; this revision targets that release's Host session and Client service interfaces.
- Node.js `>= 22.19.0`.
- The right profile: the desktop app uses `desktop`, the `dsh web` command uses `web` (see below).

## Which profile to install into

DSH installs plugins per profile. Each profile keeps its own plugin list and `node_modules`, so the desktop app and the command line do not affect each other.

| How you run DSH | Profile to use |
|---|---|
| Desktop app (DeepSeek Harness client) | `desktop` |
| `dsh web` on the command line (if you keep that profile) | `web` |

- Installing from the app's plugin page already targets the profile the app uses, so you do not pick one there.
- **Quick self-check: if the "会话地图 / Session map" switch never appears, the plugin went into the other profile** — install again with the other `--profile`.
- A desktop install takes effect after **restarting the app**; a command-line install takes effect after restarting `dsh web` and refreshing the page.

## Installation

`dsh` is the launcher that ships with the DSH runtime, at `resources\runtime\cli\bin\dsh.cmd` inside the app directory. Check that it responds first:

```powershell
dsh --version
```

### Install from npm

```powershell
# Desktop app
dsh plugin --profile desktop add dsh-synapse

# Command line (only if you keep a web profile)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-synapse
```

The npm package ships prebuilt code, so no build-script permission is needed — the simplest install. GitHub and local-checkout routes below are alternatives.

### Install from GitHub

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile desktop add github:liangmianya/dsh-synapse
```

GitHub installs run the package `prepare` script, which validates JavaScript syntax with `node --check`.

### pnpm 10+ allowBuilds

pnpm 10 and later may block build scripts for Git dependencies by default. If installation is blocked, copy the **complete key printed by pnpm** into the matching profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  "dsh-synapse@https://codeload.github.com/liangmianya/dsh-synapse/tar.gz/<commit>": true
```

Use the complete key containing the tarball URL and commit, not the bare package name `dsh-synapse`. The key changes when the upstream commit changes, so use the newly printed value when upgrading.

### Install a local checkout

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile desktop add link:E:\path\to\dsh-synapse
```

The `link:` form references the local checkout directly and is recommended for development. In a normal run, restart the host (the desktop app or `dsh web`) and refresh the page after editing the plugin.

## Start DSH Web

```powershell
dsh web
```

Default address:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3080/
```

Let DSH choose a free port when 3080 is occupied:

```powershell
dsh web --port 0
```

Open the top **Session Map** switch after startup. Do not run two `dsh web` processes that share the same profile.

## Usage

1. Select a working directory in DSH or open an existing session.
2. Send at least one message so the session enters workspace history.
3. Open **Session Map** from the top switch.
4. Click a card or sidebar session to synchronize the current session between the map and native chat.
5. Use **Branch** on a completed answer to preserve an alternative path.
6. Click a card's body to open the right-hand detail panel for that turn's full answer.
7. Use **Open in DSH** or the top **Dialogue** switch to return to native chat.

The canvas supports:

- Panning and zooming up to 4×, with the zoom stepping over several frames instead of jumping to the target.
- Dragging a card by pressing and holding anywhere on it (card bodies are not selectable, so a drag never turns into a text selection).
- A turn is two cards: a **question** card holding only the message you sent, and an **answer** card holding only the model's closing prose (no tool calls, no tool results).
- **排列** in the map toolbar picks where the question sits relative to its answer — **above / below / left / right** — by clicking one of four diagrams. Auto-layout and 整理 follow the choice, which is remembered on this machine.
- Unfolding a card with the arrow in its corner: 3 lines go to 8, and whatever sits below moves out of the way.
- The full answer lives in the detail panel, whose left edge can be dragged to resize it (380–760px, double-click to reset).
- Expanding or collapsing descendant conversation subtrees.
- One-click focus on the current session.
- Markdown rendering in the detail panel: headings, lists, task lists, quotes, rules, fenced code, tables and links.
- Folding tool calls and results into the related assistant answer by `callId`.

The **Dialogue / Session Map** switch can be moved too:

- Drag it by the six-dot grip on its left edge; the position is remembered per browser.
- Double-click the grip to return it to its shipped seat (centred under the window chrome).
- With the grip focused, the arrow keys nudge it by 8px.
- It always keeps an 8px grab margin from the viewport edges, so shrinking the window cannot strand it off screen.

## Recent changes

**0.6.0**

- The canvas and the details pane are rebuilt against DSH's own specs: one turn is a pair of cards, the details pane is a single column of conversation, and tool calls fold per turn, with card/sidebar sizes and motion matching the host.
- The top switch is draggable, remembers where you left it, and resets on a double-click (from upstream 0.5.6).
- Interaction and rendering consistency: switching a conversation now brings it into view; folding a card no longer moves the canvas; a text selection in an answer no longer freezes the sidebar and the details panel; the fold/branch buttons on a card's right edge are no longer covered by the neighbouring card.
- Workspace switching no longer races the background poll, and the canvas is rebuilt only when data actually changes instead of several times a second.
- An unreadable `workspaces.json` now fails loudly and read-only: no old backup is written over it, and the real reason reaches the banner instead of a generic notice.

## Configuration

The plugin is inserted through the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`. Override it in your own patch by targeting the row id `synapse`.

> A DSH patch replaces the row's complete `config`, so restate every value that must remain active.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dataFile` | `$DSH_HOME/synapse/workspaces.json` | Canvas metadata persistence file |
| `autoProjection` | `true` | Automatically project committed DSH session events into cards |
| `projectionWorkspaceTitle` | `DSH 任务` | Title of the automatically projected workspace |
| `trustedHosts` | `[]` | Extra host or `host:port` values accepted by the `/synapse` Host check; `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are always accepted |

Example:

```yaml
- id: synapse
  config:
    dataFile: !!js dshHomePath('synapse/my-workspaces.json')
    autoProjection: true
    projectionWorkspaceTitle: My tasks
    trustedHosts: []
```

Add the actual host to `trustedHosts` when exposing DSH on a LAN.

## Uninstall and data cleanup

Remove the plugin:

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-synapse
```

`remove` deletes the dependency and profile activation layer but keeps canvas data. Reinstalling reuses and migrates the old data when necessary.

For a complete cleanup, manually remove:

```text
$DSH_HOME/synapse/
```

A leftover `allowBuilds` key in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is harmless and may also be removed.

## Data and runtime boundaries

- DSH session logs own the actual conversation content.
- Synapse `workspaces.json` stores only canvas metadata, layout, and branch anchors.
- Deleting `workspaces.json` loses canvas layout, never DSH sessions.
- Projected message text is capped at 8000 characters; longer card text ends with “—…（详情查看全文）”, while the full content remains available in conversation details.
- The plugin starts no second Web server and creates no second agent system.

See [Architecture and runtime boundaries](../architecture.md) for details.

## Model Experience

None, as dsh-synapse only reads committed session events and renders them; it adds no system-prompt prose, tool schemas, or request-context content to any model request.

### KV Cache effect

Does not invalidate. The plugin never changes request headers, system prompts, or tool registries, so an already-reusable KV prefix stays reusable; canvas projection consumes session logs only after they are committed.

## Known limitations

- Both the `desktop` (desktop app) and `web` (`dsh web`) profiles are supported; any other profile has to add the package to its own bundle list. Installing into the wrong profile does not error — the Session map switch simply never appears.
- Two DSH Web instances sharing one profile write the same `workspaces.json`. A cross-process write lock and external-modification warnings exist, but last-writer-wins replacement remains possible; run one instance.
- During v3 migration, legacy tool cards pair each call with the next result by order. Live events pair by `callId`.
